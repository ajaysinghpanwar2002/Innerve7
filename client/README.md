2) /hotels => list of hotels 
3) /payment => payment gateway

home page 
1) input component
2) sample commands 

vulnerabilities
1) i have removed the validation for phone numbers 
2) i have remove the type for date and email => now user can enter a false params

compromise 
1) i have to remove the voice feature for fixing date 
or else i can use a package => npm date format
```
https://www.npmjs.com/package/dateformat
```

// upcoming pakages that i wil use 

1) node-geocoder => to just conavert location from text to latitute and longitude
```

```
